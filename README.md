# CLICHE

## What is Cliche?
Cliche means an expression that has been used too many times and no longer means much. (The 'e' has an accent)
### I meant this project.
Oh...I knew that. This is a CLI made in python that makes other CLIs.
### Why was this made?
IDK. I was daydreaming at school that I would make a CLI that makes other CLIs and that it would be called Cliche.
### Greatest name ever.
I know.

## How does it work?
When you run cliche init, it creates a folder called cliche_project and in it has a main.py file with sys and os imported and a basic cli.
